	</div>

	<div id="portfolioAbout">
		<p>
		Over the past three years since Engage Designs was established, we have compiled a large varying portfolio that includes works of many design fields.  Many projects below are collaborative however, some are individual evenly split between the two developers at Engage Designs.

		<div id="webDesign">
			<h2>WEB DESIGN</h2>
		<p>
We at Engage Designs believe a company’s success begins with their webpage.  This is the first thing most consumers will see which can make or break their opinion.

    <div id="webDesignText">
      <p>With plenty of experience with web design and development, we have accumulated plenty of pieces for our portfolio.  From working with startup companies and young clients to larger foundations, we have learned plenty over the years and still strive to learn more.</p>

		<h2>GRAPHIC DESIGN</h2>
    <p>
		We love graphic design as it allows us to transform our artistic skills into something digital and create masterpieces impossible with a pen and paper.
